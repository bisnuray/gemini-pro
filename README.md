## Getting Started 🚀

To utilize Gemini Pro, configure your environment with the necessary API key and service account credentials. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher 🐍
- Libraries: `google-generativeai` 📚
- Environment Variables: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` 🗝️

1. Install the required dependencies, ensuring Python 3.9 or higher:

    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai
    ```

2. Set the Google API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    set GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```

   Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual Google API key.

3. Set the path to the service account credentials as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/serviceaccount.json
    ```

   Replace `/path/to/serviceaccount.json` with the actual path to your service account JSON file.

4. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account and download the JSON key file. Follow these steps:

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Navigate to the project where you want to create a service account.
   - In the left sidebar, click on the hamburger menu and select "IAM & Admin" > "Service accounts."
   - Click on "Create Service Account" at the top of the page.
   - Enter a name for the service account, choose a role (e.g., Project > Editor), and click "Continue."
   - Skip the "Grant users access to this service account" section and click "Done."
   - Locate the newly created service account in the list and click on the pencil icon to the right.
   - Navigate to the "Add Key" tab, choose JSON as the key type, and click "Create." Save the downloaded JSON file to a secure location.
